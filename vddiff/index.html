  <h1>vddiff&mdash;Text Terminal Directory Diff Tool</h1>
  <p>vddiff is a simple text terminal directory diff tool.
  It compares two directories and uses
  <code>vim -dR</code> for the actual file diff operation
  (other diff tools can be configured).
  A file browser with lynx and vi like navigation
  displays the names found in the directories
  given on the command line:</p>
  <img src="vddiff-1.png" alt="vddiff file browser">
  <p>Opening a file with differences startes vim in diff mode
  (if vim is not installed, &ldquo;<code>diff</code> <i>file1</i>
  <i>file2</i> <code>| less</code>&rdquo; is used instead):</p>
  <img src="vddiff-2.png" alt="vim file diff view">
  <p>Merging of file contents is done with vim or the selected diff
  tool.
  If the available diff tools don't support merging, files can be
  opened separately in the file browser to edit them with e.g. vi.
  File system level merging (copying, renaming and deleting files or
  directories) is done with the tool itself.</p>
  <p>Features:
  <ul>
   <li>Transparent comparison of compressed files and directories.</li>
   <li>By use of marks files and directories can be compared
    which had been renamed or compressed in one of the file trees,
    and of files which are in different directory levels.</li>
   <li>In contrast to <code>diff</code>(1) symbolic links are not
    followed by default.</li>
   <li>All used build tools and library functions are POSIX.
    The tool had been tested on NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux,
    and Solaris.</li>
  </ul></p>
