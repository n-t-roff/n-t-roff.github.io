  <h1>vddiff&mdash;Text Terminal Directory Diff Tool</h1>
  <p>vddiff is a simple text terminal directory diff tool using
  <code>vim -dR</code> for the actual diff operation
  (other diff tools can be configured).
  A file browser with lynx and vi like navigation
  displays the names found in the directories
  given on the command line:</p>
  <img src="vddiff-1.png" alt="vddiff file browser">
  <p>Opening a file with differences startes vim in diff mode
  (if vim is not installed, &ldquo;<code>diff</code> <i>file1</i>
  <i>file2</i> <code>| less</code>&rdquo; is used instead):</p>
  <img src="vddiff-2.png" alt="vim file diff view">
  <p>Merging of file contents is done with vim or the selected diff
  tool.
  If the available diff tools don't support merging, files can be
  opened separately in the file browser to edit them with e.g. vi.
  File system level merging (copying, renaming or deleting files or
  directories) can be done with the tool itself.</p>
